 How Does HitmanPro Work?

As an additional line of security, it can detect threats that regular antivirus programs might overlook. It is designed to complement your current antivirus software.

 Users have centralized access to license management, installation file downloads, and support resources through the HitmanPro account login.

 The HitmanPro Account Login Page: How Do I Get There?
 Go to the official HitmanPro website to access your account.  Find the "Login" or "My Account" link toward the top of the page.  In order to access your HitmanPro account, please enter your registered email and password on the login page that appears when you click it.

 What Should I Do If I Cannot Remember My HitmanPro Password?
 There is a "Forgot Password?" link on the login page in case you have misplaced your password.

Resetting your password and getting back into your HitmanPro account usually doesn't take more than a few minutes.

 For help with manual recovery and identity verification in the event that you lose access to your email, please contact HitmanPro support.

 How do I ensure the safety of my account?
 Your HitmanPro account password must be strong and unique at all times.  Stay away from logging into other websites with the same credentials.  An extra safeguard can be added by activating two-factor authentication if it is available.

 Before you log into your account, make sure your device is free of spyware and keyloggers.  Get in the habit of scanning your system often with HitmanPro or another reliable antivirus program.
